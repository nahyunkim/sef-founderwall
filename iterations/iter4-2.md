# Iter 4-2

User stories implemented:
* As a user, So that I have a more engaging UI, I want to see a styled login/logout page
* As a user, So that I can quickly find information, I want a search bar
* As a user, So that my dedication feels meaningful, I want a more personable UI for the dedication page. 
* As a user, So that I have a better user experience, I want to see Sankara branding and a mobile optimized UI
* As an admin, So that I can email donors their login credentials, I want to be able to download a CSV of all donors that need to be added. 

User stories not implemented:
* As an admin, So that I can make the hospitals more interesting, I want to be able to upload photos. 
* As an admin, I want to be able to make an edit on the web app, So that it is also edited in Denari
* As a user, I want to see the most up to date information, So I know the exact status of each hospital

The reason for not implementing the uploading photos user story is that we ran out of time, given that we had to prepare presentations and the poster.
We chose to prioritize the other user stories since they were more fundamental to the operation of the app. If time permits, we will add this feature.
Like last iteration, we were unable to complete the Denari related user stories. We were never able to get the API to work, so instead we added functionality to download the app's data as a CSV
