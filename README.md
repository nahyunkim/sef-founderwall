The Sankara Eye Foundation is looking for a new way to engage donors and encourage recurring donations.
The Sankara Eye Foundation wants a "Wall of Founders" to showcase different users' donations and as
a way for donors to see the impact of their donation. The hope is that with an engaging application, 
users will immediately see the impact of their donations and in turn stay involved with the organization, 
as well as receive proper recognition for their generosity.
